Discussed our topic, get instruction on following steps.
TA suggested us to do below things for next week:
1) Find a dataset (large enough sample size, divide to training/validation/test data);
2) Read about convolutional neural network to have a better understanding of the theory;
3) Choose software platform. Python use Tensorflow?
